[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/louis-mclaughlin/gameplay-platformer.svg?branch=next)](https://travis-ci.org/louis-mclaughlin/platformer)

- Removed samples
- Removed  non-cmake projects
- Removed project setup scripts
- Removed luagen tool
- Removed download scripts
- PhysicsCharacter calculates smoothed world position
- PhysicsCharacter vertical velocity can be clamped to gravity
- PhysicsCharacter step down can ignore horizontal impulses applied rigid bodies
- PhysicsCharacter doesn't fix collisions from kinematics with the same parent as itself
- PhysicsCharacter fix collision phase has callback for ghost object intersections
- PhysicsCharacter doesn't interpolate transform changes that occur outside the simulation step

- PhysicsController can be disabled
- Forms don't clear the depth buffer
- PlatformLinux has an unlocked framerate
- CheckBox collision can be rectangular
- PhysicsCollisionObjects can be created directly from properties
- PhysicsCollisionObjects mask and group bits can be set from properties
- Added performance profiling
- Game has a callback for the physics simulation step
- Scene traversal can begin at a specific node
- Gamepad internal update occurs before physics simulation update
- Added ref counted properties wrapper
